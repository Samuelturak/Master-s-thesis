# Master's-thesis
This is the practical work of my Master's thesis.

This is the link to my Shared Google Drive folder where the datasets and models can be found:

Master_thesis.ipynb includes the Deep learning part of my work. You can observe it here, but you can also open it in Google Colab and test it. However, you would need to save the models and datasets on your drive to use it correctly.

If for some reason an error is displayed when wanting to observe the .ipynb file, you can use [Jupiter nbviewer](nbviewer.jupyter.org) to preview the file.

Matlab_codes are my MATLAB scripts that include the data generation part in my work.
